# project-euler

Solutions to various Project Euler problems.  Code is primarily in Python and Haskell, but there are a few solutions in various other languages (Clojure, Rust, C++, etc.)

Some of the code is relatively old, (dating as far back as 2014), and not always the nicest, but many of the problems have elegant mathematical and algorithmic ideas.

My solution to problem 543 was documented in this essay: [Efficient prime counting with the Meissel-Lehmer algorithm](http://acganesh.com/posts/2016-12-23-prime-counting.html).
